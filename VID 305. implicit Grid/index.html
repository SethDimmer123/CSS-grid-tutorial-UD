        <!-- iMPLCIT GRID- EXPLCILY AND CURRENTLY I HAVE NOT ADDED OR COVERED the values for my rows in css
            i don't currently have how many rows or the actual width of the rows however
            if i SPECIFICALLY SAY WHAT KIND OF COLUMNS OR HOW MANY COLUMNS I WOULD WANT
            THEN CSS GRID WILL CREATE A LAYOUT FOR ME.

            lets say in the scenario above i change my mind and just have 1 column layout only have 
            200px

            but if i want a 3 column layout then add another 200px after the 300px

            CSS GRID IS SMART IT SAYS I CAN FIT IT IN 2 ROWS

            IF I ADD MORE DIVS THEN I WILL BE BACK TO A 3 ROW LAYOUT


            SINCE I HAVE 2 COLUMNS BUT since kept on adding more items
        css grid will keep on creating rows that match the layout that i wanted which is a 
    2 column layout in this scenario but i kept on adding divs after the first 2 
    so css grid will keep on adding rows-->
